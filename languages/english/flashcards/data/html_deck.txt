0001 $$ What is HTML?$$. •HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. •HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. •HTML describes the structure of a Web page. •HTML consists of a series of elements. •HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. •HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. $$ 
0002 $$ What is an HTML Element?$$An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag: <tagname> Content goes here... </tagname> | The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: eg: <h1>My First Heading</h1> <p>My first paragraph.</p> $$ 
0003 $$ Empty Elements!$$Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> <hr> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! $$ 
0004 $$ What is the visible part of a Web Page?$$The content inside the <body>...</body> section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. $$ 
0005 $$ HTML History$$1991 Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML - 2014	W3C Recommendation: HTML5 - 2016	W3C Candidate Recommendation: HTML 5.1 - 2017 W3C Recommendation: HTML5.1 2nd Edition - 2017 W3C Recommendation: HTML5.2 $$ 
0006 $$ The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration$$The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly. It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags). The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: <!DOCTYPE html> $$ 
0007 $$ HTML is Not Case Sensitive$$HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>. The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML. $$ 
0008 $$ HTML Attributes$$All HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value" $$ 
0009 $$ You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html lang="en"> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. $$ 
0010 $$ Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country. You can see all the language codes at https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp $$ 
0011 $$ The title Attribute$$The title attribute defines some extra information about an element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element: Example: <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p> $$ 
0012 $$ We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values$$The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values. However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML. Good: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> | Bad: <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/>Visit our HTML tutorial</a> $$ 
0013 $$ Sometimes you have to use quotes in attribute values. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space: Example: <p title=About W3Schools> $$ 
0014 $$ Single or Double Quotes?$$Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used. In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes: <p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'> | Or vice versa: <p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson"> $$ 
0015 $$ HTML Headings$$HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage. HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading. Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on. Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading. $$ 
0016 $$ HTML Horizontal Rules$$The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page. The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. $$ 
0017 $$ HTML <b> and <strong> Elements$$The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance. The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold. $$ 
0018 $$ HTML <i> and <em> Elements$$The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc. The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress. $$ 
0019 $$ HTML <mark> Element$$The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted $$ 
0020 $$ HTML <del> Element$$The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text $$ 
0021 $$ HTML <ins> Element$$The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text $$ 
0022 $$ HTML <sub> Element$$The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like in H2O. $$ 
0023 $$ HTML <sup> Element$$The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]

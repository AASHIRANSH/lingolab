use of also in a sentence

use of "of you" and "of yours"
------------------------
No it wouldn’t have the same meaning.

(I haven’t listened to the song, just going off the title)

‘Your’ is a possessive indicator. For example, ‘Your picture’ would not need to have you in it. You would just need to be the owner of a particular copy or the person who created it. (And if you were rephrasing it to use ‘of’ and keep the same meaning you’d use ‘Picture of yours’)

‘Of you’ is more of a content indicator. A picture of you is a picture that definitely has you in it, and probably as a focus, regardless of whether you made it, or even ‘own’ it in the sense of possessing a copy or the rights to the image.

And maybe more relevant to the song mentioned and the potential poetic meanings… it’s possible to make your picture not your picture anymore without changing the actual image. You could sell it or give it away, and it would still largely be the same. But to make a picture of you no longer a picture of you, someone would need to edit you out completely or destroy the image itself.

a friend of you/yours
---------------------
The correct phrase is "a friend of yours."

This is one example of what's known as the double genitive. In this phrase, the form never varies: indefinite article/determiner/ number + noun + of + possessive pronoun or noun+'s/s'.

Here are some more examples:

An article of his will appear in our newspaper.
I think that dog of hers has fleas.
Two cousins of Bill's just joined the military.
